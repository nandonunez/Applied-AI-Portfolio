# Urban Waste & Energy Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🏗 System Architecture

**Power BI dashboard for visualizing and analyzing urban waste management and energy recovery.**

## 🔍 Overview

This project delivers an interactive dashboard for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing waste flows and energy recovery at a large urban treatment facility. The solution integrates multiple public datasets and provides actionable insights for operational and strategic decision-making.

### **Workflow**
1. **Data Integration:** Combines datasets on waste inputs, material recovery, energy, and biogas generation.
2. **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards with annual, monthly, and plant-level trends, color-coded by waste fraction and output type.
3. **Geospatial Analytics:** Maps treatment plants and enables drill-down analytics by location.
4. **User Interaction:** Filters by year, waste fraction, service type, district, plant, and time range.


## 🎯 Impact

* **Challenge:** Urban waste and energy data are complex and multi-dimensional, making it difficult to extract actionable insights.
* **Solution:** A modular, interactive dashboard that unifies and visualizes all key metrics for waste management and energy recovery.
* **Results:** Enables data-driven decision making, operational optimization, and transparent reporting for stakeholders.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Geospatial:** ArcGIS (optional integration)
* **Data Sources:** Public datasets (waste, materials, energy, biogas)
